# Drawing Demo

This demo shows how to use Yoha for drawing. For a fully self-contained, smaller example please consider [this](https://github.com/handtracking-io/yoha/tree/main/example).

The demo uses some utilities mainly for visualization that are not part of the Yoha npm package
right now. If you think it would make sense to include some of the utilities in the Yoha packge 
feel free to give feedback.
